I think I can create a small scale app with pandas and ts
What I am trying to do is create an app that -
- takes amount input for credit
- takes amount input for debit
- assigns user to debit or credit
- takes ts snapshot of when the entry was made
- takes manual input of the date
- prints report of transactions on user basis
- prints report of transaction on type basis
- prints report of transaction on day basis
